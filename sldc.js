// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning

// Analysis of Requirements

// Design

// Implementation

// Testing & Integration

// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = 'Analysing the requireiments that goes into building a succsessful software app via libraries system specs frame works etc aswell as initial code structure'
const Design = 'What your app does and how it functions for example if your creating a video game you should understand the languages that go into that like c++ you should also plan for extensive knowledege in 3d modeling or sprite creation etc. '
const Implementation = 'How will you implement your software. Requires the dev to pick and possibly learn a new language for the software to be implemnted/ executed properly'
const TestingIntegration = 'Testing can require things such as console.logging your code executing your code and looking for proper/ expected results etc'
const Maintain = 'Maintaining software is like maintaing any other thing similar to the real world things break down and change this is true for software software requires a dev to maintain it properly as languages change and tech changes your code for that app/ software may break and require changes'
